IRONCLAD Sprint 13 â€” Route ordering and security matrix tests

Verifies the critical FastAPI route-ordering rule:
  Static paths (/workers/healthy, /workers/schedulable, /runs/running)
  must be registered BEFORE their dynamic counterparts
  (/workers/{worker_id}, /runs/{run_id}/...) to prevent "healthy" and
  "schedulable" being interpreted as path parameters.

Also verifies:
  - Security matrix: operator-only endpoints reject missing auth
  - Schedulable includes inflight < capacity check (full capacity excluded)
  - Route names map to correct handler functions
